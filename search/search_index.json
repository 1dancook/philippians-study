Introduction (1:1-2) Observations and Notes Make Observations! 1:1 servants or slaves is not a derogatory term in that time. In fact a \"slave\" of a prominant person had more status than common people. The greek term (doulos) has the meaning of undivided devotion. 1:1 overseers are those with leadership responsibilities. The greek word was used to describe general leadership 1:1 deacons refers to those who have specific positions of service 1:2 Paul uses his own \"blessing\" version of common greetings: grace is a Greek greeting and peace is a Jewish greeting. His greeting also puts God the Father and Jesus Christ on the same level (as providers of grace and peace) Questions and Application Why does Paul refer to the Christians in Philippi as saints (v1)? This is part of the identity we have in Christ. We are not seen by God as sinners. He has vindicated us and therefore sees and treats us as if we had never sinned. A greeting of \"To all the sinners...\" would not be fitting whatsoever for a letter to Christians. Do you consider yourself a saint or a sinner? How does God see you? Thanksgiving for the Philippians (1:3-11) Observations and Notes 1:5 they have partnered in the gospel by financially supporting Paul 1:6 day of Jesus Christ = day of the Lord 1:7 Paul's situation: he is in prison Questions and Application Why is Paul in prison? Refer to Acts 21:27-36 (and further). In Jerusalem he was beat and almost killed because of teaching the gospel. But went through different trials first. At the time of writing he was waiting for his court appearance before Caesar Paul was beat and almost killed, then imprisoned for sharing the gospel. He knew this would happen because it was prophecied to him before he went to Jerusalem. Why would he be willing to go through with that? What about you? It is not necessarily easy to share the gospel. Are you afraid of even small amounts of persecution or rejection? What is a result of having abounding love, knowledge and discernment (v9-10)? ...you may approve what is excellent The result of that? ...and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. How can you be abounding in love, knowledge, and discernment? Why is this necessary? love is the thing that Christ has called us to - to love God and to love our neighbors knowledge and discernment are necessary to protect yourself or others against false teachings what does excellent mean in the phrase approve what is excellent ? likely that which aligns with truth (see Phil 4:8-9 that also mentions excellence and is linked with what they have seen and heard from Paul) The Philippian church partnered with Paul in the gospel by supporting him financially. In what ways do you think this could help him? Would you partner with someone in the gospel in this way? What does it mean that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ ? what God started he will finish doing and it will finally be complete at the second coming of Christ God is not done with you yet this certainly brings to mind the concept of sanctification (the process of being made holy).

Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, 19 for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, 20 as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. 21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 22 If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. 23 I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. 24 But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. 25 Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, 26 so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again. Observations and Notes 1:12 what has happened to me is imprisonment (1:7, 1:13, 1:17) 1:13 whole imperial guard in Rome is somewhere around fourteen thousand soldiers 1:14-18 Jewish teachers allowed for people to serve God with impure motives. It was better than not serving him at all. But they also believed that those who served God with impure motives would not have any share in the world to come. 1:19 deliverance or salvation here is a physical deliverance from prison. The Emporer Nero in A.D. 62 freed Jewish hostages that Felix had sent to him before. It's likely that Paul was released at this time since he was in prison for 2 years. Also see Acts 28:30-21. 1:19 If Paul was convicted it would have set legal precendant for other Roman Christians Questions and Application What is the result of Paul's imprisonment? served to advance the gospel brothers have become confident and speak the word without fear (1:14) He wrote letters during his imprisonment. Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. What is Paul's attitude while being imprisoned and having people trying to make it harder for him? it is for Christ (1:13) I will rejoice (1:18) What are the bad motives that some have to preach Christ? Why do they have these motives? What are good motives for preaching Christ? How can people inflict Paul in prison by preaching the gospel (v17)? They had envy , rivalry , selfish ambition and a lack of sincerity - they wanted to be better than Paul as if preaching Christ was some kind of competition. They were glad Paul was imprisoned because they had more advantage over him in preaching the gospel. They wanted him to lose in the competition. Good motives are having good will , preaching out of love . What is meant by for to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain (v21) Was Paul suicidal? He said my desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better (v23) Why does Paul desire to die? Why doesn't he want to die? He had this desire because he wanted to be with Christ. He was not suicidal, but new the potential reality of his case. If convicted he would face death. If not he would go free. He was ready to die and was not afraid of it because he knew he would be with Christ. He was convinced that it would be more gain for others to remain alive. Was it God's plan that Paul was in prison? How was he able to remain joyful and hopeful? See Acts 9:16 He had hope that God would take care of him He knew God was still using him Even though he was in prison, he was still connected with God's purpose for his life. Paul's attitude during his suffering is not self-centered at all. We can often have an attitude that is somewhat masked as something good and Christian - God is putting me through this so that I will become more like him. While that is certainly true, God often has bigger purposes than just that. Paul sees his situation in a non-selfish way. It is for the benefit of others. His life was centered on serving Jesus and proclaiming the gospel. We have purpose in life - to glorify God.
