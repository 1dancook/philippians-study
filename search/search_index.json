Introduction (1:1-2) Observations and Notes Make Observations! 1:1 servants or slaves is not a derogatory term in that time. In fact a \"slave\" of a prominant person had more status than common people. The greek term (doulos) has the meaning of undivided devotion. 1:1 overseers are those with leadership responsibilities. The greek word was used to describe general leadership 1:1 deacons refers to those who have specific positions of service 1:2 Paul uses his own \"blessing\" version of common greetings: grace is a Greek greeting and peace is a Jewish greeting. His greeting also puts God the Father and Jesus Christ on the same level (as providers of grace and peace) Questions and Application Why does Paul refer to the Christians in Philippi as saints (v1)? This is part of the identity we have in Christ. We are not seen by God as sinners. He has vindicated us and therefore sees and treats us as if we had never sinned. A greeting of \"To all the sinners...\" would not be fitting whatsoever for a letter to Christians. Do you consider yourself a saint or a sinner? How does God see you? Thanksgiving for the Philippians (1:3-11) Observations and Notes 1:5 they have partnered in the gospel by financially supporting Paul 1:6 day of Jesus Christ = day of the Lord 1:7 Paul's situation: he is in prison Questions and Application Why is Paul in prison? Refer to Acts 21:27-36 (and further). In Jerusalem he was beat and almost killed because of teaching the gospel. But went through different trials first. At the time of writing he was waiting for his court appearance before Caesar Paul was beat and almost killed, then imprisoned for sharing the gospel. He knew this would happen because it was prophecied to him before he went to Jerusalem. Why would he be willing to go through with that? What about you? It is not necessarily easy to share the gospel. Are you afraid of even small amounts of persecution or rejection? What is a result of having abounding love, knowledge and discernment (v9-10)? ...you may approve what is excellent The result of that? ...and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. How can you be abounding in love, knowledge, and discernment? Why is this necessary? love is the thing that Christ has called us to - to love God and to love our neighbors knowledge and discernment are necessary to protect yourself or others against false teachings what does excellent mean in the phrase approve what is excellent ? likely that which aligns with truth (see Phil 4:8-9 that also mentions excellence and is linked with what they have seen and heard from Paul) The Philippian church partnered with Paul in the gospel by supporting him financially. In what ways do you think this could help him? Would you partner with someone in the gospel in this way? What does it mean that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ ? what God started he will finish doing and it will finally be complete at the second coming of Christ God is not done with you yet this certainly brings to mind the concept of sanctification (the process of being made holy).

Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, 19 for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, 20 as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. 21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 22 If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. 23 I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. 24 But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. 25 Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, 26 so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again. Observations and Notes 1:12 what has happened to me is imprisonment (1:7, 1:13, 1:17) 1:13 whole imperial guard in Rome is somewhere around fourteen thousand soldiers 1:14-18 Jewish teachers allowed for people to serve God with impure motives. It was better than not serving him at all. But they also believed that those who served God with impure motives would not have any share in the world to come. 1:19 deliverance or salvation here is a physical deliverance from prison. The Emporer Nero in A.D. 62 freed Jewish hostages that Felix had sent to him before. It's likely that Paul was released at this time since he was in prison for 2 years. Also see Acts 28:30-21. 1:19 If Paul was convicted it would have set legal precendant for other Roman Christians Questions and Application What is the result of Paul's imprisonment? served to advance the gospel brothers have become confident and speak the word without fear (1:14) He wrote letters during his imprisonment. Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. What is Paul's attitude while being imprisoned and having people trying to make it harder for him? it is for Christ (1:13) I will rejoice (1:18) What are the bad motives that some have to preach Christ? Why do they have these motives? What are good motives for preaching Christ? How can people inflict Paul in prison by preaching the gospel (v17)? They had envy , rivalry , selfish ambition and a lack of sincerity - they wanted to be better than Paul as if preaching Christ was some kind of competition. They were glad Paul was imprisoned because they had more advantage over him in preaching the gospel. They wanted him to lose in the competition. Good motives are having good will , preaching out of love . What is meant by for to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain (v21) Was Paul suicidal? He said my desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better (v23) Why does Paul desire to die? Why doesn't he want to die? He had this desire because he wanted to be with Christ. He was not suicidal, but new the potential reality of his case. If convicted he would face death. If not he would go free. He was ready to die and was not afraid of it because he knew he would be with Christ. He was convinced that it would be more gain for others to remain alive. Was it God's plan that Paul was in prison? How was he able to remain joyful and hopeful? See Acts 9:16 He had hope that God would take care of him He knew God was still using him Even though he was in prison, he was still connected with God's purpose for his life. Paul's attitude during his suffering is not self-centered at all. We can often have an attitude that is somewhat masked as something good and Christian - God is putting me through this so that I will become more like him. While that is certainly true, God often has bigger purposes than just that. Paul sees his situation in a non-selfish way. It is for the benefit of others. His life was centered on serving Jesus and proclaiming the gospel. We have purpose in life - to glorify God.

This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God. 29 For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake, 30 engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have. 2:1 So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, 2 complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. 3 Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. 4 Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. 5 Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, Observations and Notes 1:27 manner of life or other translations conduct has the meaning of to live as a citizen. 1:28 frightened has a meaning as of an uncontrollable stampede of startled horses 1:30 conflict is the ancient Greek word agon , which described a place where athletic contests were held and later came to refer to the contest itself. We get our words agony and agonize from this ancient Greek word. 1:30 Paul and the Philippians were engaged in the same conflict - walking right with the Lord and proclaiming the gospel in the midst of persecution and being under attack. 1:27-30 is about standing against external conflicts 2:1~ is about standing firm against internal conflicts 2:1 if there is any... - if you received any of these things from Christ, then do what I am about to tell you 2:3 selfish ambition : desire and determination to achieve success 2:3 conceit : excessive pride in onesself. 2:3 humility in the ancient world was looked at as a flaw. It was a virtue of manhood to assert yourself over others. Questions and Application It is clear that beleivers will suffer some persecution (1:29), but how can believers collectively mitigate the affects of this? standing firm in one spirit - have unity with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel - work together in unity so that people who believe will believe more and people who don't believe will believe having the same purpose standing together we are our strongest. When we are alone we are helpless. doing so gives us confidence before our oppononets if we do stand strong together, persecution has no affect when we stand strong together it is evidence of our own salvation (1:28) Today there are different forms of persecution all over the world. What about in your life or around you? How does it make you feel? How can you stand firm in one spirit and strive for the faith of the gospel with other believers? What do these mean? It's implied that we have these things and that they are all from God encouragement in Christ comfort from love (comfort in greek = strengthening, helping, making strong) Carries the idea that we are made strong and bold by God's love. participation in the Spirit (participation=fellowship which means sharing of things in common) affection and sympathy Encouragement, comfort, affection, and sympathy are all needed in the midst of being persecuted. These things come from Jesus. We have these things as they are communicated to us in a direct and spiritual way from Jesus or from Jesus through his people.

It's implied that we have these things and that they are all from God encouragement in Christ comfort from love (comfort in greek = strengthening, helping, making strong) Carries the idea that we are made strong and bold by God's love. participation in the Spirit (participation=fellowship which means sharing of things in common) affection and sympathy Encouragement, comfort, affection, and sympathy are all needed in the midst of being persecuted. These things come from Jesus. We have these things as they are communicated to us in a direct and spiritual way from Jesus or from Jesus through his people. These are real things for the Christian to experience. What phrases are used to describe the idea of unity in this passage? How can believers have this kind of unity? 1:27 standing firm in one spirit 1:27 with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel 1:27 with one mind ... not frightened... 2:2 same mind 2:2 same love 2:2 full accord or full agreement 2:2 one mind How? Look at 2:3-4 Believers can have this by having the same mind as Christ. Look at 2:3-4 and 2:6~ When Christians suffer under persecution it will bring about more unity Can you give some examples of what this kind of unity and humility might look like in every day life? What about examples of the opposite in the church? What about your own life?

This is a continuation of the previous lesson. In the previous lesson we talked about believers having unity in the face of persecution. That unity would mitigate the effects of persecution.

Observations and Notes it is possible that 2:6-11 is an early Christian hymn but it cannot be proven Judaism highly valued obedience to the point of death in stories about its martyrs. Crucifixion was incredibly degreading (the most) form of execution.

Kenosis means \"the renunciation of the divine nature, at least in part, by Christ in the Incarnation.\" Questions and Application What does this tell us about Jesus? It shows this progression of humility 2:6 - Why didn't Jesus count \"equality with God a thing to be grasped\" ? his own interests, rights, and priveledges would have been an obsticle to his exercise of humility 2:7 - What did Jesus empty himself of and what did he become? This is highly debated and can lead to faulty theology. Example, if Jesus emptied himself of deity, he would not be God as a human. By taking the form of a slave (servant), it indicates that he became a servant. The use of \"form\" indicates that it is true servanthood. The use of \"likeness\" in \"bring born in the likeness of men\" is a greek word \"schema\" which means fashion (it is different than \"form\" like \"form of God\") When Jesus became a man, his external form (\"likeness\") (man) is contrasted with his essence (\"form\") (God) Jesus was more than human Jesus' humility came through becoming obedient to the point dying on the cross the application for the believer is that to be like Christ in this example of humility we must as well empty ourselves of our rights and priveledges, even if we have some high status, and become lowly like a servant. This kind of attitude/mind will help to produce unity. What did God do to Jesus? (2:9-11) \"highly exalted\" suggests that God gave Jesus a new position. Some translations might translate this as \"to the highest\" God gave him the name. What name? Lord.

Observations and Notes This is a continuation of what came before (\"therefore\"). Because God has highly exalted [Jesus] and bestowed on him the name that is above every name (2:11). Paul's exhortation about living in unity by being humble like Christ continues here. 2:12 - much more in my absence - Paul exhorts them to be obedient even without his oversight and supervsion. It is a matter of integrity on the part of the Philippians. 2:15-16 - Paul offers a contrast between Christians and non-Christians: blameless and innocent vs crooked and twisted light vs. dark holding fast the word of life vs. rejecting or not understanding the gospel 2:15 - innocent can be translated as harmless and has then sense of not being able to harm. Picture an animal with horns that does not use them to horn or an animal such a sheep that has no horns and is unable to harm. He means to be like sheep. 2:16 - day of Christ is the day of the Lord when Christ will return. 2:16 - holding fast to the word of life - holding strongly onto the gospel. In the context with connotations of the Israelites in the wilderness it is also reminiscent of clinging on to the promises of God. 2:17 - poured out as a drink offering conotates Old Testament sacrificial imagery. Paul is glad to offer himself to God in service as it is for his glory. Questions and Application Why does Paul write work out your salvation with fear and trembling ? (2:12) work out has the meaning of applying your salvation in your life. It is not about earning salvation. If that were the meaning it would directly contradict a great deal of other theology that Paul has written. God has accomplished salvation for you, now the application of what he has done in every day life must be worked out. The obedience demanded of Christians in this passage is paralleled with Christ's example in 2:8 - he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. True obedience comes from reverence, not fright. \"There is a sense in which our salvation is complete, in the sense that Jesus has done a complete work for us. Still there is also a sense in which our salvation is incomplete, in that it is not yet a complete work in us.\" (Guzik) Do not forget what comes next - that it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure. (2:13). What does it mean that God ... works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure ? (2:13) It is the work of the Holy Spirit to enable believers to do God's will. We cannot do God's will without the power of the Holy Spirit. If we try, what we are effectively doing is saying 'no' to how God wants to work in us and through us. We would effectively be living according to the law by our flesh. Why do people grumble and dispute? Grumbling and disputing are terms that are used to describe the Israelites in the wilderness. They set an example for us of what happens when we have such attitudes. It is not just completely selfish, it is also open rebellion against God. There are various thoughts about why Paul wrote this. It may have been in relation to a problem the Philippians had. It may have been about their response to their circumstances (persecution). It may have been a response to their attitude towards God. Regardless, Paul's statement is all encompassing - do all things 2:15 - crooked and twisted generation seems to also have the backdrop of the Israelites (Deut 32:5) and applied here in the sense that those who are in rebellion against God's will be grumbling and disputing with God. God has put you in the situation you are in now. He is in control. Do you grumble and complain about it? What is your attitude? Rather than grumble and complain, what kind of attitude can we have? What can we draw from Paul's example of being willing to be poured out as a drink offering (2:17)? This refers to the practice of pouring something on an offering before it was sacrificed. See also Numbers 15:4-5. The Philippians are offering up their faith, and Paul is serving in such a way that it enriches the offering. This certainly brings up an image of Paul being willing to completely sacrifice himself for the Philippians. It may be alluding to potential execution as he is in prison. For us this is an interesting example to remember that as others serve Christ we can also enrich their offering to the Lord by serving them.","title":"3-3 Exhortation (2:12-18)"},{"location":"03-03-exhortation.html#3-3-exhortation-212-18","text":"","title":"3-3 Exhortation (2:12-18)"},{"location":"03-03-exhortation.html#main-passage","text":"Philippians 2:12-18 ESV 12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, 13 for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure. 14 Do all things without grumbling or disputing, 15 that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, 16 holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. 17 Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. 18 Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me.","title":"Main Passage"},{"location":"03-03-exhortation.html#observations-and-notes","text":"This is a continuation of what came before (\"therefore\").

But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 28 I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious. 29 So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor such men, 30 for he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me. Observations and Notes Paul desires to send Timothy, also to go himself. But he trusts the Lord's timing for this. Messengers were often sent as personal representatives, to be received with the same honor accorded the sender (e.g., 2 Sam 19:37-38). Teachers and disciples often developed an intimate relationship described in terms of \"father\" and \"son.\" News was difficult to send, because it had to be carried by messenger---a sometimes dangerous undertaking given travel conditions at various times of the year (cf. 2:30). Paul therefore wants to wait until he can give a full report of the outcome of his trial. Evidence that Epaphroditus took this letter to the Philippians.

He wants to be cheered by news about them. We have to remember that at this time there is no form of communication apart from letters and messengers. How were the Philippian Christians doing?

To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you. 2 Look out for the dogs, look out for the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh. 3 For we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh\u2014 4 though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: 5 circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; 6 as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless. 7 But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. 8 Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith\u2014 10 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 11 that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead. 12 Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. 13 Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, 14 I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 15 Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you. 16 Only let us hold true to what we have attained. Observations and Notes 3:1 to 4:1 is considered a digression (a departure from the main topic) but this is common in ancient speaking and writing. 3:3 we are the circumcision Things we learn about Paul: circumcised Israelite (vs. converted proselytes that had lower social status in Judaism) from the Tribe of Benjamin a 'Hebrew of Hebrews' (could indicate a Palestinian Jewish origin but not clear) A Pharisee (in terms of obedience to the law). Incredibly strict and meticulous obedience to the law. a persecutor of the church (because of zeal for what he believed) considered himself blameless under the law (righteous) gain and loss are marketplace terms 3:8 Dung (KJV) or rubbish (ESV, NIV, NASB, NRSV) usually meant either excrement or food to be thrown away, which dogs might enjoy (3:2). (Ancient speakers valued skill in producing insolent insults.) Many pagans thought of circumcision as a form of mutilation, and the Roman emperor Hadrian later outlawed it under an anticastration law. 3:3 worship by the Spirit of God is a reference to some kind of charismatic worship since the Spirit of God is connected much with prophecy. Paul doesn't consider himself to be perfect, but is aiming for being sanctified and made perfect (3:10-13) Questions and Application Who are the dogs and why does Paul warn about them? Do we have this kind of problem in Christianity today? Paul calls them evildoers and those who mutilate the flesh (another term for circumcision). Likely traveling Jewish Christian teachers that want to circumcise Gentiles. Paul encountered them in Galatia. dogs is a term used for Cynic Philosophers (believing that people are motivated only by selfishness) and was a disdainful term. Jewish teaching considered dogs unclean and also has connotations of sexual immorality (applied to male cult prostitutes). Paul warns them because these people have a purpose to teach Christians to go back to the law in order to live. This is a key that Paul discusses in Galatians as well. We do have this problem in Christianity. In fact, not only is it widespread, it is very hard to discern at times that it is there. This passage speaks about putting confidence in the flesh. What does that mean and why would someone do that? Putting confidence in the flesh is basically a persons own religious effort to attain good standing with God and perhaps try to know him.

For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith\u2014 10 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 11 that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead. 12 Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. 13 Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own.

Incredibly strict and meticulous obedience to the law. a persecutor of the church (because of zeal for what he believed) considered himself blameless under the law (righteous) gain and loss are marketplace terms 3:8 Dung (KJV) or rubbish (ESV, NIV, NASB, NRSV) usually meant either excrement or food to be thrown away, which dogs might enjoy (3:2). (Ancient speakers valued skill in producing insolent insults.) Many pagans thought of circumcision as a form of mutilation, and the Roman emperor Hadrian later outlawed it under an anticastration law. 3:3 worship by the Spirit of God is a reference to some kind of charismatic worship since the Spirit of God is connected much with prophecy. Paul doesn't consider himself to be perfect, but is aiming for being sanctified and made perfect (3:10-13)","title":"Observations and Notes"},{"location":"05-01-press-goal.html#questions-and-application","text":"Who are the dogs and why does Paul warn about them? Do we have this kind of problem in Christianity today? Paul calls them evildoers and those who mutilate the flesh (another term for circumcision). Likely traveling Jewish Christian teachers that want to circumcise Gentiles. Paul encountered them in Galatia. dogs is a term used for Cynic Philosophers (believing that people are motivated only by selfishness) and was a disdainful term. Jewish teaching considered dogs unclean and also has connotations of sexual immorality (applied to male cult prostitutes). Paul warns them because these people have a purpose to teach Christians to go back to the law in order to live. This is a key that Paul discusses in Galatians as well. We do have this problem in Christianity. In fact, not only is it widespread, it is very hard to discern at times that it is there. This passage speaks about putting confidence in the flesh. What does that mean and why would someone do that? Putting confidence in the flesh is basically a persons own religious effort to attain good standing with God and perhaps try to know him. Paul has legitimate reasons to be confident in the flesh, but why does he consider his gain in the flesh as loss , and rubbish ? one reason, his opponents (the dogs) would have confident in these things.

(3:17-4:1) Main Passage Philippians 3:17-4:1 ESV 17 Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us. 18 For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ. 19 Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things. 20 But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, 21 who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself. 4:1 Therefore, my brothers, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord, my beloved. This passage continues from the previous line of thought. Paul is warning the Philippians about the dogs who would encourage them to turn to religious deeds in order to attempt to have good standing before the Lord. Instead of that, Paul now urges them to imitate him and stand firm. Observations and Notes ancient teachers often used themselves as examples 3:18 - weeping indicates Paul's love for those who have become enemies of the cross Gluttony became part of Roman culture, and it was frequently referenced to as humurous insult. Being ruled by one's own \"belly\" was about gluttony, but much more: it carries the meaning of fleshly indulgence (one translation says \"bodily desires\"). Calling those who are zealous for the law gluttons would be a serious insult. It's ironic in a sense that those who are zealous for the law would be obsessed with food laws, and here they are called gluttons. 4:1 That the Philippians are Paul's \"crown\" indicates that they are in some sense his prize savior was a term used for Julias Ceaser. Lord was also used to refer to him. in 3:20 it is significant that Paul refers to Jesus this way in the context of talking about citizenship. Questions and Application What would it mean to imitate Paul? Why is Paul a good example? Who in your life is a good example of Christian life? If you don't have someone, it is a good idea to get someone (for example, a mentor). We constantly are looking for examples to follow. That means someone may also be looking at your life to follow your example. With that in mind, what would you change? Why are some people walking as enemies of the cross? Who are these people? People who thought that their soul was okay (saved) and they could do what they want. They are enemies of the cross - enemies of the gospel. They did not want to take up the cross to follow Jesus (self-denial) Destruction? This can refer to either their ultimate damnation or to the present destruction of their lives. Probably their ultimate damnation is more in view. their god is their belly (glutony) (Broader meaning implied - they live for the pleasures of the body, mind, and soul.) they glory in their shame (in other words: They gloried about things they should have been ashamed about.) with minds set on earthly things (This describes the focus of their life) What does this passage tell us about what will happen when Christ comes back (this is about the resurrection)? Paul's view of the resurrection is that it involves the body, but one distinct in nature from the current body (Greek culture considered the idea of a bodily resurrection vulgar superstition; see comment on 1 Cor 15). As in Judaism, the resurrection occurs at the time of the ultimate battle, when God subordinates all his enemies (cf. also 1 Cor 15:25-28). When we are resurrected, we will have the same type of body that Jesus Himself had when he was resurrected. He was resurrected in a new body, patterned after the old yet equipped and fitted for heaven. What does it mean that we have citizenship in heaven? (v20) citizenship was rare and prized The citizens of Philippi were automatically citizens of Rome.

The Lord is at hand; 6 do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. 7 And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. 8 Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. 9 What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me\u2014practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you. Beginning here Paul strings together some moral admonitions that can seem unrelated, however there is a common theme. Observations and Notes true companion 4:3 is unknown. There is a Clement in early church history who was the leader of the church in Rome and wrote two letters to the church in Corinth. It's unknown if this is the same Clement (very common name). the Lord is near is a phrase that could mean the 2nd coming of Jesus or just mean that the Lord is close and hears his people's prayers. In the context (given the next sentence in verse 6) it is more plausible that this is meaning that the Lord is close and is listening. prayer broad meaning of communicating with God. supplication is directly asking God to do something. Questions and Application It's unknown what the problem was between Euodia and Syntyche, but, what can you surmise? Why is Paul's admonition to agree in the Lord a good solution? (Some translations say, be of the same mind in the Lord ) Not much is known about these two but they may have been foreign merchants. They were Paul's coworkers - so they must have been from somewhere that Paul had visited. It was unresolvable It was a known problem to others in the church It was an important issue for both of them (not willing to compromise) Paul's advice is to not forget their common ground in Jesus and to remember that other things, while important, are not as important as their common ground. Have you ever experienced a disagreement with someone like this? This kind of admonition may be quite important for political discussions What does it mean to rejoice in the Lord always (4:4)? It is emphasized by repitition. In the context of a quarrel, we may take from this that in order to avoid such problems, if we are rejoicing in the Lord it certainly sets the priorities of our hearts right. For example, if we are not thankful for what we have (rejoicing) then we may end up being jealous for what someone else has and covet. In the context of a quarrel, Paul exhorts the Philippian church to also let their reasonableness (read:gentleness) be known to all men (4:5). What does this mean? the word for gentleness has a broad range of meaning: gentleness, patience, softness, patient mind, modesty, forbearance, unwillingness to content in the context of a quarrel, this admonition has a meaning describing people who will let the Lord fight their battles. They will lay down their right, and let God deal with it. If we handle our quarrels and even problems in other ways, we can have a great number of anxieties. What is anxiety? How is it possible to not be anxious about anything ? What about the peace that Paul talks about (4:7)? Anxiety is: similar to fear, but different overzealous concern about the future focus on temporary things heart is monopolized by a particular care your mind in the wrong world - utterly consumed with the temporal world and not with the kingdom of God Legitimate care becomes anxiety and therefore can become sin when: when our thoughts are consumed with the future and fixing the future so many \"what if\" thoughts that consume us when thoughts control me instead of me controlling thoughts What steps does Paul have here?

You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. 11 Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. 12 I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. 13 I can do all things through him who strengthens me. 14 Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble. 15 And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only. 16 Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again. 17 Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit. 18 I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. 19 And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 20 To our God and Father be glory forever and ever.

Paul expresses his gratitude towards the Philipiian church for their support. Extra reading: 2 Corinthians 8 talks about the giving of churches in Macedonia, of which Philippi is a part of. Observations and Notes verse 10 - you had no opportunity means that Paul had no need and so they couldn't give. Pauls \"abundance\" in verse 12 would have been meager and simple. He was an artisan (tent maker) and, although better off than the poor, would have been below the the standard of living enjoyed by modern middle class in the west. fruit in verse 17 is also profit in other translations. letters often included greetings from people other than the author because they were not sent often (they had to be sent via travelers). Questions and Application What did Paul learn about being content? How? in every situation he should be content he learned this through experiencing situations and relying on Jesus What does `I can do all things through him who strengthens me.\" mean in its context? Jesus gives me the strength in any situation to be content Why is it important to be content regarding our needs? Are you content with what you have? Why do we become discontent? If we are not content, we can approach fulfilling our needs in a sinful way we can become discontent by unhealthy desires and jealousy What observations can you make about the connection of giving and ministry? giving = sharing (4:14) giving = partnership (4:15) the partnership involves giving and receiving (4:15) the giving part involves sending help for needs (4:16) the receiving part is fruit of ministry (4:17) - this could be seen as how investments work. When you invest in something, you get back what you invested with profit. the giving part is an act of worship (4:18) Read 2 Corinthians 8:1-5. Philippi is among the churches of Macedonia. What do you observe about their giving? they were going through a hard time their giving was not from abundance, but when they were in poverty they were generous they gave beyond their means (v3) it was by God's will these people are being sacrificial and giving beyond what they really should, trusting God to take care of them. What is the meaning of verse 19 in its context? Paul cannot pay back the Philippians, but God can and he trusts that he will. the promise is broad and yet restricted at the same time - all but only needs it's important to consider who Paul is speaking this to - not in the sense that it only applies to them, but in the sense of their situation. I doubt this promise applies to just anyone, but more specifically it is to those who have been greatly sacrificial in their giving consider also Luke 6:38 What about you? What thoughts do you have about giving your money to those in need (especially those in ministry)? What is Paul's attitude about receiving gifts? He is not seeking them, but he is seeking that they will receive fruit (in other words, his focus is on the ministry)","title":"7 - God's provision and Paul's Contentment (4:10-23)"},{"location":"07-provision-contentment.html#7-gods-provision-and-pauls-contentment-410-23","text":"","title":"7 - God's provision and Paul's Contentment (4:10-23)"},{"location":"07-provision-contentment.html#main-passage","text":"Philippians 4:10-23 ESV 10 I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me.

If we are not content, we can approach fulfilling our needs in a sinful way we can become discontent by unhealthy desires and jealousy What observations can you make about the connection of giving and ministry? giving = sharing (4:14) giving = partnership (4:15) the partnership involves giving and receiving (4:15) the giving part involves sending help for needs (4:16) the receiving part is fruit of ministry (4:17) - this could be seen as how investments work. When you invest in something, you get back what you invested with profit. the giving part is an act of worship (4:18) Read 2 Corinthians 8:1-5. Philippi is among the churches of Macedonia. What do you observe about their giving? they were going through a hard time their giving was not from abundance, but when they were in poverty they were generous they gave beyond their means (v3) it was by God's will these people are being sacrificial and giving beyond what they really should, trusting God to take care of them. What is the meaning of verse 19 in its context? Paul cannot pay back the Philippians, but God can and he trusts that he will. the promise is broad and yet restricted at the same time - all but only needs it's important to consider who Paul is speaking this to - not in the sense that it only applies to them, but in the sense of their situation. I doubt this promise applies to just anyone, but more specifically it is to those who have been greatly sacrificial in their giving consider also Luke 6:38 What about you? What thoughts do you have about giving your money to those in need (especially those in ministry)? What is Paul's attitude about receiving gifts? He is not seeking them, but he is seeking that they will receive fruit (in other words, his focus is on the ministry)","title":"Questions and Application"}]}
