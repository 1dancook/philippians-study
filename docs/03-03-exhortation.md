# 3-3 Exhortation (2:12-18)

## Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Philippians 2:12-18 ESV"
    **12** Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, **13** for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.  

    **14** Do all things without grumbling or disputing, **15** that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, **16** holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. **17** Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. **18** Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me.  


## Observations and Notes
- This is a continuation of what came before ("therefore"). Because `God has highly exalted [Jesus] and bestowed on him the name that is above every name` (2:11). Paul's exhortation about living in unity by being humble like Christ continues here.
- 2:12 - `much more in my absence` - Paul exhorts them to be obedient even without his oversight and supervsion. It is a matter of integrity on the part of the Philippians.
- 2:15-16 - Paul offers a contrast between Christians and non-Christians: 
    - `blameless and innocent` vs `crooked and twisted`
    - `light` vs. dark
    - `holding fast the word of life` vs. rejecting or not understanding the gospel
- 2:15 - `innocent` can be translated as `harmless` and has then sense of not being able to harm. Picture an animal with horns that does not use them to horn or an animal such a sheep that has no horns and is unable to harm. He means to be like sheep.
- 2:16 - `day of Christ` is `the day of the Lord` when Christ will return.
- 2:16 - `holding fast to the word of life` - holding strongly onto the gospel. In the context with connotations of the Israelites in the wilderness it is also reminiscent of clinging on to the promises of God. 
- 2:17 - `poured out as a drink offering` conotates Old Testament sacrificial imagery. Paul is glad to offer himself to God in service as it is for his glory. 


## Questions and Application
1. Why does Paul write `work out your salvation with fear and trembling`? (2:12)
    - `work out` has the meaning of applying your salvation in your life. It is not about earning salvation. If that were the meaning it would directly contradict a great deal of other theology that Paul has written. God has accomplished salvation for you, now the application of what he has done in every day life must be worked out.
    - The obedience demanded of Christians in this passage is paralleled with Christ's example in 2:8 - `he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.` 
    - True obedience comes from reverence, not fright. 
    - *"There is a sense in which our salvation is complete, in the sense that Jesus has done a complete work for us. Still there is also a sense in which our salvation is incomplete, in that it is not yet a complete work in us." (Guzik)*
    - *Do not forget what comes next* - that `it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.` (2:13). 

2. What does it mean that `God ... works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure`? (2:13)
    - It is the work of the Holy Spirit to enable believers to do God's will.
    - We cannot do God's will without the power of the Holy Spirit. If we try, what we are effectively doing is saying 'no' to how God wants to work in us and through us. We would effectively be living according to the law by our flesh.

3. Why do people grumble and dispute?
    - `Grumbling and disputing` are terms that are used to describe the Israelites in the wilderness. They set an example for us of what happens when we have such attitudes. It is not just completely selfish, it is also open rebellion against God.
    - There are various thoughts about why Paul wrote this. It may have been in relation to a problem the Philippians had. It may have been about their response to their circumstances (persecution). It may have been a response to their attitude towards God. Regardless, Paul's statement is all encompassing - `do all things`
    - 2:15 - `crooked and twisted generation` seems to also have the backdrop of the Israelites (Deut 32:5) and applied here in the sense that those who are in rebellion against God's will be grumbling and disputing with God. 

5. God has put you in the situation you are in now. He is in control. Do you grumble and complain about it? What is your attitude?
    - Rather than grumble and complain, what kind of attitude can we have?

6.  What can we draw from Paul's example of being willing to be `poured out as a drink offering` (2:17)?
    - This refers to the practice of pouring something on an offering before it was sacrificed. See also Numbers 15:4-5.
    - The Philippians are offering up their faith, and Paul is serving in such a way that it enriches the offering.
    - This certainly brings up an image of Paul being willing to completely sacrifice himself for the Philippians. It may be alluding to potential execution as he is in prison.
    - For us this is an interesting example to remember that as others serve Christ we can also enrich their offering to the Lord by serving them.
