# 6 - Exhortations (4:2-9)

## Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Philippians 4:2-9 ESV"
    **2** I entreat Euodia and I entreat Syntyche to agree in the Lord. **3** Yes, I ask you also, true companion, help these women, who have labored side by side with me in the gospel together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.  

    **4** Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. **5** Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; **6** do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. **7** And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.  

    **8** Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. **9** What you have learned and received and heard and seen in meâ€”practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.  


Beginning here Paul strings together some moral admonitions that can seem unrelated, however there is a common theme.

### Observations and Notes
- `true companion` 4:3 is unknown.
- There is a `Clement` in early church history who was the leader of the church in Rome and wrote two letters to the church in Corinth. It's unknown if this is the same Clement (very common name).
- `the Lord is near` is a phrase that could mean the 2nd coming of Jesus or just mean that the Lord is close and hears his people's prayers. In the context (given the next sentence in verse 6) it is more plausible that this is meaning that the Lord is close and is listening.
- `prayer` broad meaning of communicating with God. `supplication` is directly asking God to do something.


### Questions and Application
1. It's unknown what the problem was between Euodia and Syntyche, but, what can you surmise? Why is Paul's admonition to `agree in the Lord` a good solution? (Some translations say, `be of the same mind in the Lord`)
    - Not much is known about these two but they *may* have been foreign merchants. They were Paul's coworkers - so they must have been from somewhere that Paul had visited.
    - It was unresolvable
    - It was a known problem to others in the church
    - It was an important issue for both of them (not willing to compromise)
    - Paul's advice is to not forget their common ground in Jesus and to remember that other things, while important, are not as important as their common ground.
    - Have you ever experienced a disagreement with someone like this? 
    - This kind of admonition may be quite important for political discussions

2. What does it mean to `rejoice in the Lord always` (4:4)?
    - It is emphasized by repitition.
    - In the context of a quarrel, we may take from this that in order to avoid such problems, if we are rejoicing in the Lord it certainly sets the priorities of our hearts right. For example, if we are not thankful for what we have (rejoicing) then we may end up being jealous for what someone else has and covet.

3. In the context of a quarrel, Paul exhorts the Philippian church to also let their reasonableness (read:gentleness) be known to all men (4:5). What does this mean?
    - the word for `gentleness` has a broad range of meaning: gentleness, patience, softness, patient mind, modesty, forbearance, unwillingness to content
    - in the context of a quarrel, this admonition has a meaning describing people who will let the Lord fight their battles. They will lay down their right, and let God deal with it. 
    - If we handle our quarrels and even problems in other ways, we can have a great number of anxieties.

4. What is anxiety? How is it possible to `not be anxious about anything`? What about the `peace` that Paul talks about (4:7)?
    - Anxiety is:
        - similar to fear, but different
        - overzealous concern about the future
        - focus on temporary things
        - heart is monopolized by a particular care
        - your mind in the wrong world - utterly consumed with the temporal world and not with the kingdom of God
    - Legitimate care becomes anxiety and therefore can become sin when:
        - when our thoughts are consumed with the future and fixing the future
        - so many "what if" thoughts that consume us
        - when thoughts control me instead of me controlling thoughts
    - What steps does Paul have here?
    - What does the `peace of God` do and what is it like?
        - Guard hearts and minds against what?

5. What are we to think about (4:8)?
    - the mind is incredibly important and what we think and meditate on matters a great deal.
    - Romans 12:2 - be transformed by the renewing of your mind
    - 2 Cor 10:5 - bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ

6. What is `meditation`?
    - biblical meditation is not an emptying of the mind. Many have concluded that eastern meditation style of emptying the mind is spiritually dangers (because it will be filled with something!)
    - it is action
    - it is not passive
    - it is active
    - it is like a cow chewing cud
