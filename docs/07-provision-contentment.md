# 7 - God's provision and Paul's Contentment (4:10-23)

## Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Philippians 4:10-23 ESV"

    **10** I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. **11** Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. **12** I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. **13** I can do all things through him who strengthens me.  

    **14** Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble. **15** And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only. **16** Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again. **17** Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit. **18** I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. **19** And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. **20** To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.  

    **21** Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you. **22** All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household.  

    **23** The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
