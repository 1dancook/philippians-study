# 5-2 Imitate their example. (3:17-4:1)

## Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Philippians 3:17-4:1 ESV"
    **17** Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us. **18** For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ. **19** Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things. **20** But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, **21** who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.  

    **4:1** Â Therefore, my brothers, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord, my beloved.  


This passage continues from the previous line of thought. Paul is warning the Philippians about the `dogs` who would encourage them to turn to religious deeds in order to attempt to have good standing before the Lord. *Instead* of that, Paul now urges them to imitate him and stand firm.

## Observations and Notes
- ancient teachers often used themselves as examples
- 3:18 - `weeping` indicates Paul's love for those who have become enemies of the cross
-  Gluttony became part of Roman culture, and it was frequently referenced to as humurous insult. Being ruled by one's own "belly" was about gluttony, but much more: it carries the meaning of fleshly indulgence (one translation says "bodily desires"). Calling those who are zealous for the law gluttons would be a serious insult. It's ironic in a sense that those who are zealous for the law would be obsessed with food laws, and here they are called gluttons.
-  4:1 That the Philippians are Paul's "crown" indicates that they are in some sense his prize
-  `savior` was a term used for Julias Ceaser. `Lord` was also used to refer to him. in 3:20 it is significant that Paul refers to Jesus this way in the context of talking about citizenship.

## Questions and Application

1. What would it mean to imitate Paul? Why is Paul a good example?

2. Who in your life is a good example of Christian life? If you don't have someone, it is a good idea to get someone (for example, a mentor).
    - We constantly are looking for examples to follow. That means someone may also be looking at your life to follow your example. With that in mind, what would you change?

3. Why are some people walking as enemies of the cross?
    - Who are these people? People who thought that their soul was okay (saved) and they could do what they want. They are enemies of the cross - enemies of the gospel. They did not want to take up the cross to follow Jesus (self-denial)
    - Destruction? This can refer to either their ultimate damnation or to the present destruction of their lives. Probably their ultimate damnation is more in view.
    - their god is their belly (glutony) (Broader meaning implied - they live for the pleasures of the body, mind, and soul.)
    - they glory in their shame (in other words: They gloried about things they should have been ashamed about.)
    - *with* minds set on earthly things (This describes the focus of their life)

4. What does this passage tell us about what will happen when Christ comes back (this is about the resurrection)?
    - Paul's view of the resurrection is that it involves the body, but one distinct in nature from the current body (Greek culture considered the idea of a bodily resurrection vulgar superstition; see comment on 1 Cor 15). As in Judaism, the resurrection occurs at the time of the ultimate battle, when God subordinates all his enemies (cf. also 1 Cor 15:25-28).
    - When we are resurrected, we will have the same type of body that Jesus Himself had when he was resurrected.
    - He was resurrected in a new body, patterned after the old yet equipped and fitted for heaven.


5. What does it mean that we have citizenship in heaven? (v20)
    - citizenship was rare and prized
    - The citizens of Philippi were automatically citizens of Rome. So they understand quite well what it meant to be citizens of the supreme city while not yet living there and never having been there.
    - your conduct must match your citizenship. (Barclay)
