# 5-2 Imitate their example. (3:17-4:1)

## Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Philippians 3:17-4:1 ESV"
    **17** Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us. **18** For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ. **19** Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things. **20** But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, **21** who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.  

    **4:1** Â Therefore, my brothers, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord, my beloved.
