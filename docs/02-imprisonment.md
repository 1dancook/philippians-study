# 2 - Paul's Imprisonment (1:12-26)

## Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Philippians 1:12-26 ESV"
    **12** I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel, **13** so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ. **14** And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.  

    **15** Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. **16** The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. **17** The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. **18** What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice.  

    Yes, and I will rejoice, **19** for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, **20** as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. **21** For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. **22** If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. **23** I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. **24** But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. **25** Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, **26** so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.  


### Observations and Notes




- **1:12** `what has happened to me` is imprisonment (1:7, 1:13, 1:17)
- **1:13** `whole imperial guard` in Rome is somewhere around fourteen thousand soldiers
- **1:14-18** Jewish teachers allowed for people to serve God with impure motives. It was better than not serving him at all. But they also believed that those who served God with impure motives would not have any share in the world to come.
- **1:19** `deliverance` or `salvation` here is a physical deliverance from prison. The Emporer Nero in A.D. 62 freed Jewish hostages that  Felix had sent to him before. It's likely that Paul was released at this time since he was in prison for 2 years. Also see Acts 28:30-21.
- **1:19** If Paul was convicted it would have set legal precendant for other Roman Christians

### Questions and Application

1. What is the result of Paul's imprisonment?
    - served to advance the gospel
    - brothers have become confident and speak the word without fear (1:14)
    - He wrote letters during his imprisonment. Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.

2. What is Paul's attitude while being imprisoned and having people trying to make it harder for him?
    - it is `for Christ` (1:13)
    - `I will rejoice` (1:18)


3. What are the bad motives that some have to preach Christ? Why do they have these motives? What are good motives for preaching Christ? How can people inflict Paul in prison by preaching the gospel (v17)?
    - They had `envy`, `rivalry`, `selfish ambition` and a lack of sincerity - they wanted to be better than Paul as if preaching Christ was some kind of competition.
    - They were glad Paul was imprisoned because they had more advantage over him in preaching the gospel.
    - They wanted him to lose in the competition.
    - Good motives are having `good will`, preaching `out of love`. 

4. What is meant by `for to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain` (v21) Was Paul suicidal? He said `my desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better` (v23) Why does Paul desire to die? Why doesn't he want to die?
    - He had this desire because he wanted to be with Christ. 
    - He was not suicidal, but new the potential reality of his case. If convicted he would face death. If not he would go free. He was ready to die and was not afraid of it because he knew he would be with Christ.
    - He was convinced that it would be more gain for others to remain alive.

5. Was it God's plan that Paul was in prison? How was he able to remain joyful and hopeful?
    - See Acts 9:16
    - He had hope that God would take care of him
    - He knew God was still using him
    - Even though he was in prison, he was still connected with God's purpose for his life. 
    - Paul's attitude during his suffering is not self-centered at all. We can often have an attitude that is somewhat masked as something good and Christian - *God is putting me through this so that I will become more like him.* While that is certainly true, God often has bigger purposes than just that. Paul sees his situation in a non-selfish way. It is for the benefit of others. His life was centered on serving Jesus and proclaiming the gospel.
    - We have purpose in life - to glorify God. In the midst of some difficult time we can sulk, or we can continue in the purpose God has given us. Even more specifically, how we can glorify God to the people around us.

6.  Have you ever felt like you wanted out of God's plan because it was hard? What can you do if you feel like that?
    - *"God didn't waste Paul's time during the Roman imprisonment. God never wastes our time, though we may waste it by not sensing God's purpose for our lives at the moment."*

7.  What does Paul's desire to stay alive for the benefit of others say about him?
