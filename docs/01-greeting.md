## Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Philippians 1:1-11 ESV"
    **1** Â Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,  
    
    To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons:  
    
    **2** Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
    
    **3** I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, **4** always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy, **5** because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now. **6** And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. **7** It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. **8** For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus. **9** And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, **10** so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, **11** filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
