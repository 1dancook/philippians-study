# 1 - Greetings and Prayer (1:1-11)

## Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Philippians 1:1-11 ESV"
    **1** Â Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,  
    
    To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons:  
    
    **2** Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  
    
    **3** I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, **4** always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy, **5** because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now. **6** And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. **7** It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. **8** For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus. **9** And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, **10** so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, **11** filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.  

## Introduction (1:1-2)
### Observations and Notes
Make Observations!

- 1:1 `servants` or `slaves` is not a derogatory term in that time. In fact a "slave" of a prominant person had more status than common people. The greek term (doulos) has the meaning of undivided devotion.
- 1:1 `overseers` are those with leadership responsibilities. The greek word was used to describe general leadership
- 1:1 `deacons` refers to those who have specific positions of service
- 1:2 Paul uses his own "blessing" version of common greetings: `grace` is a Greek greeting and `peace` is a Jewish greeting. His greeting also puts God the Father and Jesus Christ on the same level (as providers of grace and peace)


### Questions and Application

1. Why does Paul refer to the Christians in Philippi as saints (v1)?
    This is part of the identity we have in Christ. We are not seen by God as sinners. He has vindicated us and therefore sees and treats us as if we had never sinned. A greeting of "To all the sinners..." would not be fitting whatsoever for a letter to Christians.

2. Do you consider yourself a saint or a sinner? How does God see you?

## Thanksgiving for the Philippians (1:3-11)

### Observations and Notes
- 1:5 they have partnered in the gospel by financially supporting Paul
- 1:6 `day of Jesus Christ` = day of the Lord 
- 1:7 Paul's situation: he is in prison
- 
### Questions and Application
1. Why is Paul in prison?
    - Refer to Acts 21:27-36 (and further). In Jerusalem he was beat and almost killed because of teaching the gospel. But went through different trials first.
    - At the time of writing he was waiting for his court appearance before Caesar

2. Paul was beat and almost killed, then imprisoned for sharing the gospel. He knew this would happen because it was prophecied to him before he went to Jerusalem. Why would he be willing to go through with that? What about you? It is not necessarily easy to share the gospel. Are you afraid of even small amounts of persecution or rejection?

3. What is a result of having abounding love, knowledge and discernment (v9-10)?
    - `...you may approve what is excellent`
    - The result of that? `...and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.`

4. How can you be abounding in love, knowledge, and discernment? Why is this necessary?
    - love is the thing that Christ has called us to - to love God and to love our neighbors
    - knowledge and discernment are necessary to protect yourself or others against false teachings
    - what does `excellent` mean in the phrase `approve what is excellent`? likely that which aligns with truth (see Phil 4:8-9 that also mentions excellence and is linked with what they have seen and heard from Paul)

5. The Philippian church partnered with Paul in the gospel by supporting him financially. In what ways do you think this could help him? Would you partner with someone in the gospel in this way?

6. What does it mean that `he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ`?
    - what God started he will finish doing and it will finally be complete at the second coming of Christ
    - God is not done with you yet
    - this certainly brings to mind the concept of sanctification (the process of being made holy). This is a process that started when we believed, continues as we follow God, and will be completed when we see Christ (see 1 John 3:2).
