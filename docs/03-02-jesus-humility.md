# 3-2 Jesus, the ultimate example of humility. (2:6-11)

## Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Philippians 2:6-11 ESV"
    **6** who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, **7** but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. **8** And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. **9** Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, **10** so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, **11** and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.  


This is a continuation of the previous lesson. In the previous lesson we talked about believers having unity in the face of persecution. That unity would mitigate the effects of persecution. It's also important for Christians to be unified to fight internal issues as well (like selfish living). This passage continues by bringing deep definition to the concept of humility by showing the example of Christ.

## Observations and Notes
- it is possible that 2:6-11 is an early Christian hymn but it cannot be proven
- Judaism highly valued obedience to the point of death in stories about its martyrs. 
- Crucifixion was incredibly degreading (the most) form of execution. It was only for non-Roman criminals of the lowest status. 
- 2:6 "form" (in greek morpha) suggests Jesus' complete diety
- 2:10 people often bowed the knee in respect before a ruler or diety. 
- For 2:10-11 see also Isaiah 45:23
- this passage is often known as the kenosis passage. Kenosis means *"the renunciation of the divine nature, at least in part, by Christ in the Incarnation."*

## Questions and Application

1. What does this tell us about Jesus? 
    - It shows this progression of humility

2. 2:6 - Why didn't Jesus count "equality with God a thing to be grasped" ?
    - his own interests, rights, and priveledges would have been an obsticle to his exercise of humility
  
3. 2:7 - What did Jesus empty himself of and what did he become?
    - This is highly debated and can lead to faulty theology. Example, if Jesus emptied himself of deity, he would not be God as a human.
    - By taking the form of a slave (servant), it indicates that he became a servant. The use of "form" indicates that it is true servanthood.
    - The use of "likeness" in "bring born in the likeness of men" is a greek word "schema" which means fashion (it is different than "form" like "form of God")
    - When Jesus became a man, his external form ("likeness") (man) is contrasted with his essence ("form") (God)
    - Jesus was more than human
    - Jesus' humility came through becoming obedient to the point dying on the cross
    - the application for the believer is that to be like Christ in this example of humility we must as well empty ourselves of our rights and priveledges, even if we have some high status, and become lowly like a servant. This kind of attitude/mind will help to produce unity.


4. What did God do to Jesus? (2:9-11)
    - "highly exalted" suggests that God gave Jesus a new position. Some translations might translate this as "to the highest"
    - God gave him the name. What name? Lord. (v11)

5. What is the result of God's actions towards Jesus?
    - 2:10-11 every knee will bow and every tongue confess
    - The posture and the confession imply submissive reverence



6. Who is included in bowing the knee and confessing that Jesus is Lord? (verse 10,11)
   - whatever category any being falls under, all will bow and confess.
   - This includes all heavenly beings, gods, people, the dead, the living, etc.


7. Does 2:10-11 make a case for universalism?
    - universalism is "the belief that all humankind will eventually be saved: Christian universalism would insist that Christ's atonement did atone for everyone's sins." (so regardless of confession of faith, all people are saved)
    - bowing and confessing are not necessarily actions from those that love
    - See Psalm 110:1 - these enemies are defeated
    - To assert these verses convey universalism would be a direct contradiction to a great number of passages in the New Testament.

8. What does Christ's example of humility mean for us in terms of unity?
 -  Paul starts this in verse 5 by saying, "Have this mind among yourselves..."
