# 5-1 Pressing on to the Goal (3:1-16)

## Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Philippians 3:1-16 ESV"
    **1**  Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you.  

    **2** Look out for the dogs, look out for the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh. **3** For we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh— **4** though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: **5** circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; **6** as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless. **7** But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. **8** Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ **9** and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith— **10** that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, **11** that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.  

    **12** Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. **13** Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, **14** I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. **15** Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you. **16** Only let us hold true to what we have attained.  




## Observations and Notes
- 3:1 to 4:1 is considered a digression (a departure from the main topic) but this is common in ancient speaking and writing.
- 3:3 `we are the circumcision`
- Things we learn about Paul:
    - circumcised Israelite (vs. converted proselytes that had lower social status in Judaism)
    - from the Tribe of Benjamin
    - a 'Hebrew of Hebrews' (could indicate a Palestinian Jewish origin but not clear)
    - A Pharisee (in terms of obedience to the law). Incredibly strict and meticulous obedience to the law.
    - a persecutor of the church (because of zeal for what he believed)
    - considered himself blameless under the law (righteous)
- `gain` and `loss` are marketplace terms
- 3:8 `Dung` (KJV) or `rubbish` (ESV, NIV, NASB, NRSV) usually meant either excrement or food to be thrown away, which dogs might enjoy (3:2). (Ancient speakers valued skill in producing insolent insults.)
- Many pagans thought of circumcision as a form of mutilation, and the Roman emperor Hadrian later outlawed it under an anticastration law.
- 3:3 `worship by the Spirit of God` is a reference to some kind of charismatic worship since the Spirit of God is connected much with prophecy.
- Paul doesn't consider himself to be perfect, but is aiming for being sanctified and made perfect (3:10-13)

## Questions and Application

1. Who are the `dogs` and why does Paul warn about them? Do we have this kind of problem in Christianity today?
    - Paul calls them `evildoers` and `those who mutilate the flesh` (another term for circumcision). 
    - Likely traveling Jewish Christian teachers that want to circumcise Gentiles. Paul encountered them in Galatia.
    - `dogs` is a term used for Cynic Philosophers (believing that people are motivated only by selfishness) and was a disdainful term. Jewish teaching considered dogs unclean and also has connotations of sexual immorality (applied to male cult prostitutes). 
    - Paul warns them because these people have a purpose to teach Christians to go back to the law in order to live. This is a key that Paul discusses in Galatians as well.
    - We do have this problem in Christianity. In fact, not only is it widespread, it is very hard to discern at times that it is there.

2. This passage speaks about putting confidence in the flesh. What does that mean and why would someone do that?
    - Putting confidence in the flesh is basically a persons own religious effort to attain good standing with God and perhaps try to know him.

3. Paul has legitimate reasons to be confident in the flesh, but why does he consider his `gain` in the flesh as `loss`, and `rubbish`?
    - one reason, his opponents (the dogs) would have confident in these things. Paul completely refutes their claims by showing that even though he is better than they are in these respects, it is garbage.
    - what is in the flesh has is of no gain when following Christ. 
    - he wants to know Jesus

4. What constitutes knowing Jesus? What is Paul really going after?
    - 3:8 to gain Christ (with marketplace terms, to be rich with Christ)
    - 3:9 to be found in him
    - 3:9 not have a righteousness that comes from law (something produced of the flesh, verses given by God)
    - 3:9 have righteousness from God that comes through faith in Christ
    - 3:10 to know him
    - 3:10 to know the power of his resurrection (Christ's new life in the power of the Spirit for right now)
    - 3:10 to share in his suffering (Paul connects knowing Christ with sharing his sufferings and glory)
    - 3:10 to become like Jesus in his death
    - 3:11 attain the resurrection from the dead
    - 3:12 the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus

5. What kind of confidence do you have in the flesh? What kind of gain do you think you have in the flesh? Why is this a problem according to this passage? 
    - Maybe you grew up in a Christian home
    - Maybe you have read the Bible 10x more than your friends
    - Maybe you went to Bible School
    - Maybe you have never drank alcohol
    - Maybe you're a 'very good person'
