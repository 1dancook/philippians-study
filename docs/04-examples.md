# 4 - Examples of Timothy and Ephaphroditus (2:19-30)

## Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Philippians 2:19-30 ESV"

    **19** I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you. **20** For I have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare. **21** For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. **22** But you know Timothy's proven worth, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel. **23** I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me, **24** and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also.  

    **25** I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need, **26** for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill. **27** Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. **28** I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious. **29** So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor such men, **30** for he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.
