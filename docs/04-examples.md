# 4 - Examples of Timothy and Ephaphroditus (2:19-30)

## Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Philippians 2:19-30 ESV"

    **19** I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you. **20** For I have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare. **21** For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. **22** But you know Timothy's proven worth, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel. **23** I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me, **24** and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also.  

    **25** I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need, **26** for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill. **27** Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. **28** I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious. **29** So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor such men, **30** for he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.


## Observations and Notes

- Paul desires to send Timothy, also to go himself. But he trusts the Lord's timing for this.
- Messengers were often sent as personal representatives, to be received with the same honor accorded the sender (e.g., 2 Sam 19:37-38). Teachers and disciples often developed an intimate relationship described in terms of "father" and "son."
- News was difficult to send, because it had to be carried by messenger---a sometimes dangerous undertaking given travel conditions at various times of the year (cf. 2:30). Paul therefore wants to wait until he can give a full report of the outcome of his trial.
- Evidence that Epaphroditus took this letter to the Philippians. 
- Epaphroditus delivered a message to Paul, stayed there some time, and got sick.

## Questions and Application

1. Why does Paul want to send Timothy to the Philippians? 
    - He wants to be cheered by news about them. We have to remember that at this time there is no form of communication apart from letters and messengers. How were the Philippian Christians doing? Were they walking faithfully with Jesus?
    - He will be genuinly concerned for their welfare. (v20)
    - Paul recognizes there is a need for someone to care for them.

2. Who is "they" in verse 21? 

3. What does Paul want to send Epaphroditus to the Philippians?
    - To send the letter.

4. Epaphroditus is an example of a loving man.
    - he risked his life to serve his brother Paul by bringing him a message
    - He was distressed that his brothers and sisters back home knew he was ill (because it was sad for them).
    - his reputation was good (they would rejoice when seeing him return)


5. Epaphroditus came close to death for doing the `work of Christ` - which was to deliver a message and gift. This can seem so insignificant. God can use us in seemingly significant and insignificant ways. Do you feel sometimes that the things you do for Jesus are insignificant?
