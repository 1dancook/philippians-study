# 3-1 Unity by Humility (1:27-2:5)

## Main Passage

!!! Scripture "Philippians 1:27-2:5 ESV"
    **27** Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel, **28** and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God. **29** For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake, **30** engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.  

    **2:1** Â So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, **2** complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. **3** Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. **4** Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. **5** Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, 

## Observations and Notes
- 1:27 `manner of life` or other translations `conduct` has the meaning of `to live as a citizen.` 
- 1:28 `frightened` has a meaning as of an uncontrollable stampede of startled horses
- 1:30 `conflict` is the ancient Greek word *agon*, which described a place where athletic contests were held and later came to refer to the contest itself. We get our words agony and agonize from this ancient Greek word. 
- 1:30 Paul and the Philippians were engaged in the same conflict - walking right with the Lord and proclaiming the gospel in the midst of persecution and being under attack.
- 1:27-30 is about standing against external conflicts
- 2:1~ is about standing firm against internal conflicts
- 2:1 `if there is any...` - if you received any of these things from Christ, then do what I am about to tell you
- 2:3 `selfish ambition`: desire and determination to achieve success
- 2:3 `conceit`: excessive pride in onesself.
- 2:3 `humility` in the ancient world was looked at as a flaw. It was a virtue of manhood to assert yourself over others.

## Questions and Application
1. It is clear that beleivers will suffer some persecution (1:29), but how can believers collectively mitigate the affects of this?
    - `standing firm in one spirit` - have unity
    - `with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel` - work together in unity so that people who believe will believe more and people who don't believe will believe
    - doing so gives us confidence before our oppononets
    - if we do stand strong together, persecution has no affect
    - when we stand strong together it is evidence of our own salvation (1:28)

2. Today there are different forms of persecution all over the world. What about in your life or around you? How does it make you feel? How can you stand firm in one spirit and strive for the faith of the gospel with other believers?

3. What do these mean? It's implied that we have these things and that they are all from God
    - `encouragement in Christ` 
    - `comfort from love` (comfort in greek = strengthening, helping, making strong) Carries the idea that we are made strong and bold by God's love.
    - `participation in the Spirit` (participation=fellowship which means sharing of things in common) 
    - `affection and sympathy`
    - Encouragement, comfort, affection, and sympathy are all needed in the midst of being persecuted. These things come from Jesus.
    - We have these things as they are communicated to us in a direct and spiritual way from Jesus or from Jesus through his people. These are real things for the Christian to experience.

4. What phrases are used to describe the idea of unity in this passage? How can believers have this kind of unity?
    - 1:27 `standing firm in one spirit`
    - 1:27 `with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel`
    - 1:27 `with one mind ... not frightened...`
    - 2:2 `same mind`
    - 2:2 `same love`
    - 2:2 `full accord` or *full agreement*
    - 2:2 `one mind`
    - Believers can have this by having the same mind as Christ. Look at 2:3-4 and 2:6~

6. Can you give some examples of what this kind of unity and humility might look like in every day life? What about examples of the opposite in the church? What about your own life?

7. How can you cultivate this kind of unity in your own life and help others to do so?
